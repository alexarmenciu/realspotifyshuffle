# realspotifyshuffle
Spotify has a faux shuffle implemented by default, which at times can annoy me, so I created a real shuffle function for Spotify using Python and its libraries Flask and Spotipy.

Click shuffle to create a new shuffled playlist called shuffled playlist

Click Shuffle Another Playlist to delete the shuffled playlist

thats basically it, enjoy!
